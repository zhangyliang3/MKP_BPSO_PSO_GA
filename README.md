# MKP_BPSO_PSO_GA
Intelligent Algorithms homework

## 简单描述

This research paper focuses on the Multiple Knapsack Problem (MKP), which is solved by transforming the problem into two models in the real and integer domains. The MKP problem in the integer domain is solved using Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA), while the MKP problem in the real domain is solved using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). By running these three algorithms on 718 different instances and comparing them with classical dynamic programming methods, the
we evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of these algorithms and explore possible improvement strategies. In addition, this report
In addition, this report summarizes the various methods for solving the MKP problem in the current research field.
